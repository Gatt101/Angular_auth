# JWT Authentication 

I have implememented jwt authentication and authorization using Angular as my frontend and SpringBoot as backend. Used MySQL as the DBMS for the simplier implementation can also work with any other DBMS fine.
Motivation behind  building this simple project is it act as a  fundamental building block which can be simply integrate in other projects too.
YT resources used for this project 
For frontend : WDCoders 
For backend : Telusko
